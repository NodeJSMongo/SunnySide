        <P>"I am doing it wrong", realized after I've spent enough time & money. It was back in 2008, when I planned to do a masters degree in England.
          I can't forget that incident even after 10 years. Altough, I've forgetten all my economic loses by this time but those memories of frustration.</p>
        <p class="about__page-header"><i>I had faith on them not because of their exaggerated offers but because of their relation with me.</i></p>
        <p>Along with a lots of mistakes like,
        <ul>
          <li>not having enough knowledge about visa, admission in foreign countries,</li>
          <li>being scared about doing anything myself,</li>
        </ul>
         biggest mistakes were submitting my passport and giving good amount of money in advance to the agency. I hope nobody does these mistakes.
       </p>
        <p>There is no dreamland of medicines exists where each disease has many cures. Off course, some medicines can cure many diseases.
        Medicine named "agency" couldn't cure my disease. Instead, it made me weaker day by day.
        So, I stopped taking "agency" and help myself got cured. I did it myself on my way to NewZealand then to Canada.
        I successfully done it for my family & friends too. I volunteered a lot on this.</p>

        <p>I am not retiring from volunteering. I am still a volunteer until I entirely take your job on my hand.
          Means, I will assess your documents for free, guide you to write documents for free. If you want me to organize and write your documents for you, its not free.</p>
          <p>My suggestions before you decided to pay me for any of my service/s,
            <ol>
              <li>Learn enough on what you are going to do.</li>
              <li>Find out exactly what kind of help you need.</li>
              <li>Try your best to find out the right person to get help.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        <p>I am here to help you. It's my passion and profession.</p>
        <p>Love & respect <br/>
          Mohammad Mamunur Rahman, owner of Polaric Student Support.</p>
